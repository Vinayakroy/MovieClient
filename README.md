## Chapter 1: Frontend Routing
Welcome to the MovieClient project tutorial! In this chapter, we're going to unravel a fundamental concept in modern web development: Frontend Routing. Think of it as the internal map and GPS system for our website. It's how your browser knows what to display when you click a link or type an address.

## What Problem Does Frontend Routing Solve?
Imagine a traditional website where every time you click a link, the entire page reloads. It's like going to a new physical store by magically teleporting there, but each time you do, you have to rebuild the store from scratch! This can make web applications feel slow and clunky.

Frontend routing solves this problem by allowing us to change the content displayed on the screen without reloading the entire webpage. This creates a much smoother, faster, and more app-like experience. It's like navigating through different sections of a large store without ever leaving the building.
